# **Challenge**

New federal rules on HRAs were adopted too late to be fully integrated into State Based Exchange (SBE) application systems, creating the risk of consumer errors that could result in large tax bills. 

# **Objective**

State Health & Value Strategies (SHVS) and IdeaCrew have developed a web-based decision support tool that will calculate employee costs based on employer’s monthly contribution amount. The tool will help consumers understand options for obtaining health coverage and affordability based on employer-offered benefit type and contribution amount.  The tool will also provide consumers with educational material, resources, and web links. 
For State-based Exchanges (SBEs) and other hosting agencies, the HRA Tool offers simple setup with tenant-based site branding and configuration with state-level information so that it may be used across the country. 

# **Background**

The Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) enables small employers to establish a company-funded, tax-free benefit to reimburse consumers for personal health care expenses.  QSEHRA is available to employers with 50 consumers or less and caps benefit amounts at $5,150 for self-employed business owners and $10,450 for consumers with dependents.  QSEHRA has been characterized as an alternative to traditional group insurance and is an excepted benefit under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) is a new program for which regulations were finalized in June. ICHRA enables employers to establish a company-funded, tax-advantaged benefit to reimburse consumers for personal health care expenses.  ICHRAs are available to employers of any size, there are no allowance caps, and employers may vary eligibility and allowance by employee class.  To qualify for ICHRA, consumers must purchase individual health coverage.  consumers using ICHRA, however, aren’t eligible for ACA premium tax credits.  Based on several factors, it may be more affordable for an employee to waive ICHRA benefits in order to take advantage of ACA financial assistance.

At present, consumers have limited information available to compare and support decision-making between QSEHRA, ICHRA, and individual market coverage. The decision to require implementation of ICHRA for this open enrollment period, notwithstanding that final regulations were issued just recently in June, exacerbates potential employee confusion. Small employers must understand the different costs associated with their health benefit options since their monthly contributions could negatively impact their employee’s tax credit amount.  consumers must understand the options available under employer-offered benefits and have the ability to determine affordability of each option. 

# **Open Source Approach**

The objective of this project is to deliver software which will be published to Github. The open source code base for the HRA  Tool will be available for any hosting agency or individual to download a copy and utilize how they see fit. The first release of tool will be provide a fully functional external user facing anonymous experience available to any hosting agency designed to be a stand alone feature or integrated into a software suite as needed.
