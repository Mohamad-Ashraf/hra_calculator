    This tool is for people who have been offered a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) by an employer to help pay for health insurance for 2020. If you are offered certain types of HRAs, you may not qualify for [a tax credit] to help purchase a [MARKETPLACE] plan. This tool will help you determine how the HRA you're offered affects your eligibility for [a tax credit] and what to do next.

    There are several types of HRAs, and only some of them require you to use this tool. If your HRA requires use of this tool, you should have received a clear written notice from your employer explaining the terms of the HRA. You will need that notice, along with information to help estimate your 2020 household income, when you are ready to use this tool.

    Purchasing health insurance:
    •  Your HRA can help pay for a [MARKETPLACE] plan or [similar coverage off Marketplace.] You can also use it if you're enrolled in Medicare. If your employer has offered you a “salary reduction agreement” to pay the share of the health insurance premium not covered by the HRA, you may be better off using your HRA to buy [an ACA-compliant plan off Marketplace. Ask your employer about your options.]
    •  If you buy a [MARKETPLACE] plan, do not accept [a tax credit], or you may owe money back at tax time. [HOW TO ENROLL THROUGH MARKETPLACE WITHOUT APTC]
