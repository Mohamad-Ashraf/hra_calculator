      This tool is for people who have been offered a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) by an employer to help pay for health insurance for 2020. If you are offered certain types of HRAs, you may not qualify for [a tax credit] to help purchase a [MARKETPLACE] plan. This tool will help you determine how the HRA you're offered affects your eligibility for [a tax credit] and what to do next.

      There are several types of HRAs, and only some of them require you to use this tool. If your HRA requires use of this tool, you should have received a clear written notice from your employer explaining the terms of the HRA. You will need that notice, along with information to help estimate your 2020 household income, when you are ready to use this tool.

        This is your household income before taxes. For most people, annual household income is the same as federal adjusted gross income that you enter on your federal income tax return (Form 1040). Specifically, household income is equal to adjusted gross income plus the following amounts: Social Security benefits that are otherwise excluded from gross income, interest from tax-exempt bonds, any foreign-source income excluded from gross income under section 911 of the Internal
        Revenue Code (rare), and the income of dependents who are required to file a separate income tax return (rare).

          Purchasing health insurance:
          •  Your HRA can help pay for a [MARKETPLACE] plan or [similar coverage off Marketplace.] You can also use it if you're enrolled in Medicare. If your employer has offered you a “salary reduction agreement” to pay the share of the health insurance premium not covered by the HRA, you may be better off using your HRA to buy [an ACA-compliant plan off Marketplace. Ask your employer about your options.]
          •  If you buy a [MARKETPLACE] plan, do not accept [a tax credit], or you may owe money back at tax time. [HOW TO ENROLL THROUGH MARKETPLACE WITHOUT APTC]
          Informing your employer:
          •  If you enroll in a [MARKETPLACE] plan, [similar coverage off Marketplace], or Medicare, inform your employer that you are accepting the HRA.
          •  If you enroll in any other coverage – including more limited coverage[ such as a short-term plan] – or you decide not to purchase health insurance, you cannot use your HRA and must notify your employer that you are opting out.
        unaffordable: |-
          To find out if you’re eligible for [a tax credit], you will complete the [MARKETPLACE] application. But first, here are some important things to keep in mind:
          When completing the application:
          •  [Answer “no” when asked if you’re offered health insurance by an employer (unless you are separately offered health insurance by another employer).]
          •  If you qualify for [a tax credit], it will generally be larger than your HRA amount.
          •  If you enroll with [a tax credit], notify your employer that you are opting out of the HRA. You cannot receive both an HRA and [a tax credit] from [MARKETPLACE]. If you receive both, you may owe money back at tax time.
          If you don't receive [a tax credit]:
          •  Your HRA can help pay for a [MARKETPLACE] plan or [similar coverage off Marketplace.] You can also use it if you're enrolled in Medicare. If you enroll in one of these types of coverage, inform your employer that you are accepting the HRA.
          •  If you enroll in any other coverage – including more limited coverage[ such as a short-term plan] – or you decide not to purchase health insurance, you cannot use your HRA and must notify your employer that you are opting out.
          •  If your employer has offered you a “salary reduction agreement” to pay the share of health insurance premium not covered by the HRA, you may be better off using your HRA to buy [an ACA-compliant plan off Marketplace. Ask your employer about your options.]
