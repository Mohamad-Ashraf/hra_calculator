                                      This is your household income before taxes. For most people, annual household income is
                                      the same as federal adjusted gross income that you enter on your federal income tax return (Form 1040).
                                      Specifically, household income is equal to adjusted gross income plus the following amounts: 
                                      Social Security benefits that are otherwise excluded from gross income, interest from tax-exempt bonds, 
                                      any foreign-source income excluded from gross income under section 911 of the Internal
                                      Revenue Code (rare), and the income of dependents who are required to file a separate income tax return (rare).
