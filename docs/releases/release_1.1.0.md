## Whatâ€™s Included in this Release?

In this release we have delivered another set of UI enhancements with the target of exceeding 508 compliance stardards. In addition, we have improved the operational response of the consumer experience by:

- Removing unused javascript and css
- Optimizing docker images
- Insuring contrast ratio of foreground and background color is AA compliant
- Considerably improved navigation by keyboard
- Increasing the coverage of the consumer facing portal for users with assistive technology (e.g. screen readers) 
- Enabling http/2 and gzip compression on the server

## Remember 

- If you want to update from version 1.0.0, there is absolutely no need to reconfigure the HRA from the admin interface. 
- If updating from a version earlier than 1.0.0 to take full advantage of the latest version of the software, we recommend that you launch & reconfigure your application from the admin interface. The software update itself will not automatically remove any existing configurations.  Follow the improved [installation instructions](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/installation/) for your respective environment. 
- We have pre-loaded a Spanish language translation generously provided and verified for accuracy by [SHVS](https://www.shvs.org/about/). Translations entered by the admin user dynamically respond to the browser language preference set by the end user. 
- The HRA Tool Community site [Plans Page](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/configuration/#plans-page---import-plan-information) section has been updated release with [release 0.3.0](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/releases/release_0.3.0/) to reflect the latest plan loading instructions. 
- Conversations held in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ideacrew/hra_calculator/issues) have helped to improve the content of this site. We encourage you to help yourself and others in our community by sharing your stories during the installation and configuration process.
