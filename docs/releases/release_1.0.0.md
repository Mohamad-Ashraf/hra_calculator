## What’s Included in this Release?

In this release we have delivered our most significant feature enhancement since the [MVP Release](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/releases/mvp_release/). The admin user now has access to full language customization and I8n translation tools that will provide more flexibility to the state exchanges & their consumers. The I8n enhancements respond directly to browser language preferences selected by the end user to display the translations stored in the HRA Tool.  

- We removed the Tools UI page from the marketplace admin interface in favor of the ‘Translations’ page providing the following functionality:
  - Ability to edit format and content of consumer facing static text, tool tips and dynamic messaging. 
  - Ability to add language translations for up to 11 supported languages in addition to English. 
- On the marketplace profile page we have introduced the ability to create, edit & remove specified languages translations.
- On the enterprise page of the admin portal we have provided the ability to reset the HRA Tool database via a “Purge HRA Tool Database” if needed. 
- Included as part of this release, are a number of IE [browser support](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/supported_browsers/) bugs.
- Automated test and specs have also been enhanced. 

## Remember 

- If you want to update to take full advantage of the latest version of the software we recommend that you launch & reconfigure your application from the admin interface. The software update itself will not automatically remove any existing configurations.  Follow the improved [installation instructions](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/installation/) for your respective environment. 
- We have pre-loaded a Spanish language translation generously provided and verified for accuracy by [SHVS](https://www.shvs.org/about/). Translations entered by the admin user dynamically respond to browser language preference set by the end user. 
- The HRA Tool Community site [Plans Page](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/configuration/#plans-page---import-plan-information) section has been updated release with [release 0.3.0](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/releases/release_0.3.0/) to reflect the latest plan loading instructions. 
- The conversations we have had on our weekly calls during implementation as well as in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ideacrew/hra_calculator/issues) have helped to improve the content of this site. We encourage you to help yourself and others in our community by sharing your stories during the installation process.
