## Scope Overview

The initial development of the HRA Tool -- labeled Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Release -- includes a solution that supports two primary stakeholders: 1) Anonymous Consumer, and 2) SBE System Administrator.

The Anonymous Consumer experience is designed as a 3-5 Web page workflow with instructions, forms to collect consumer information (per state configuration) and results page presenting a determination.  The informtion collected includes the following, subject to SBE configurations:

* Employee Age
* Employee Residence (State-only, State and County, or State, County and Zip)
* Projected Income
* HRA type
* HRA amount 
* HRA start & end date

The System Admininstrator experience is designed to enable SBE staff to customize the system to match their state's policies and enrollment system.  This includes capabilities to:

* Define a Markeplace
* Upload plans and premiums
* Specify age and geographic rating area settings
* Customize key terms and text that appear on Consumer portal
* Upload logo, set colors and typeface on Consumer portal


## Delivery Goal
The task taken on by IdeaCrew and State Health and Value Strategies (SHVS) is to produce and release a decision support tool within 45-60 days following a notice to proceed with development. 

The goal in this short timeline is to deliver a fully functional consumer facing tool designed for broad SBE adoption in time for 2020 Open Enrollment.
