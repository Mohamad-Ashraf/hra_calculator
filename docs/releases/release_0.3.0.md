## What’s Included in this Release?

Since the [release 0.2.0](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/releases/release_0.2.0/) on 10/11, the team has been busy making some adjustments to ensure the overall quality of the tool meets expectations. Below you can find the details about what is new:

- Tightened up a few gramatical issues on various pages throughout the application.
- Corrected the disclaimer text on the results page for all possible results.   
- Updated the first tool tip on the "About You" page to reflect “This is the family member whose employer is offering the HRA.”
- Increased & improved automated test coverage for consumer facing portal. 

## Remember 

- If you want to update to take full advantage of the latest version of the software we recommend that you launch & reconfigure your application from the admin interface. The software update itself will not automatically remove any existing configurations.  Follow the improved [installation instructions](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/installation/) for your respective environment. 
- The HRA Tool Community site [Plans Page](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/configuration/#plans-page---import-plan-information) section has been updated after [release 0.2.0](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool/releases/release_0.2.0/) to reflect the latest plan loading instructions. 
- The conversations we have had on our weekly calls during implementation as well as in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ideacrew/hra_calculator/issues) have helped to improve the content of this site. We encourage you to help yourself and others in our community by sharing your stories during the installation process.
