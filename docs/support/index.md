# Support

The HRA Tool project's scope of work covers development of the initial application plus installation tools and documentation.  Although the application doesn't come with free support, as a state based exchange using or interested in using the HRA Tool you have options:

* **For just about anything to do with the HRA Tool**, this Community site is your first stop.  It includes documentation on [project origin](https://ideacrew.github.io/hra_calculator/hra_tool_project/), how to [install](../hra_tool/installation) the application, [configure](../hra_tool/configuration) it for your SBE, understand how it [determines affordability](../hra_tool/affordability_determination) and more. 

* **If you are an SBE not currently using the HRA Tool and have questions or need assistance with setup**, please [contact State Health and Value Strategies](../contact_us) .

* **If you have an issue with the system that you think may be a bug**, start by making sure you are running the latest version of the [software](https://github.com/ideacrew/hra_calculator).  Next, check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ideacrew/hra_calculator/issues) to see if the issue was raised and answered already.  If not, create a new issue.  

* **If you are looking for hosting services, integration services, or extentions to the HRA Tool software** you are encourated to contact [IdeaCrew](../contact_us), original developers of the HRA Tool.  Published under an open source license, you are also free to do this yourself or obtain these services from other qualified solution providers.
