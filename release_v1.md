# **Scope Overview**

Anonymous consumer experience designed to be a 3-5 page workflow based on the following key information from the user:
* Age & Location (Zip and or County depending on state based configuration)
* Projected Income & frequency
* HRA Type
* HRA amount & frequency
* HRA start & end date

System admin experience designed to allow an SBE admin to configure key information needed for the tool to function specific to the state in which it will be utilized. 
* Branding
* Plan & Benefit Data Loading
* Key customizable text 

#### The functionality mentioned above is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solution allowing the HRA Tool to be adopted by as many SBEs as possible in the timeline available. 

# **Delivery Goal**
The task taken on by IdeaCrew and State Health and Value Strategies (SHVS) was to produce and release a decision support tool within 45-60 days following a notice to proceed with development. 
The goal in this short timeline is to deliver a fully functional consumer facing tool designed to be adopted and utilized by as many SBEs as possible.
