Project History

The Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) is a new program for which regulations were finalized in June 2019. ICHRA enables employers to establish a company-funded, tax-advantaged benefit to reimburse employees for personal health care expenses.

Recognizing that all State Based Exchanges would need to provide their consumers with consistent, relevant and accurate information around these reimbursement arrangements, in particular their relationship to (and potential impact on) eligibility for Insurance Affordability Programs like APTC, State Health and Value Strategies sought funding and a development partner to make a single, flexible tool available to all states.

IdeaCrew, Inc, was selected as the development partner and a funding grant was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson foundation, with a shared, ambitious goal of providing a working tool to all interested SBE’s in time for Open Enrollment 2020 (11/1/2019).

Stakeholders from interested SBE’s, SHVS and IdeaCrew collaborated closely to rapidly iterate on both design and software development activities to arrive at a solution called the HRA Tool, which allows stakeholders the flexibility to host their own version of the tool, configure it to use their own branding, geographic and rating information, and tailor question text specific to the requirements of their state constituents.
