# **About**

State Health & Value Strategies (SHVS) and IdeaCrew have developed a web-based decision support tool that will calculate employee costs based on employerâ€™s monthly contribution amount. The tool will help consumers understand their options for obtaining health coverage and affordability based on employer-offered HRA type and contribution amount. The tool will also provide consumers with educational material, resources, and web links. For State-based Exchanges (SBEs) and other hosting agencies, the HRA Tool offers simple setup with tenant-based site branding and configuration with state-level information so that it may be used across the country.
