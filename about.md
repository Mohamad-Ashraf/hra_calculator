# **About**

IdeaCrew and State Health & Value Strategies (SHVS) have developed a web-based decision support tool that will calculate employee costs based on employerâ€™s monthly contribution amount. The tool will help employees understand options for obtaining health coverage and affordability based on employer-offered benefit type and contribution amount. For State-based Exchanges (SBEs) and other hosting agencies, the HRA Affordability Tool offers simple setup with tenant-based site branding and configuration with state-level information so that it may be used across the country.
