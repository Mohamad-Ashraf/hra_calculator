## Getting Started

As the health care needs of everyday Americans continues to evolve, so too must our State Based Exchanges (SBEs) and the solutions they provide. Organizations like State Health & Value Strategies, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and IdeaCrew, Inc encourage the growth of communities where technology and people meet in service of others. 

These two organizations have come together to establish a stronger community amongst our SBEs while delivering valuable open source technology. The development of the HRA Tool as an open source, multi tenant capable solution does not represent the end to a single problem. It represents another step toward a world where people come together with technology and a purpose to produce boundless possibilities. 

*Support for this tool was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of the Foundation.*
