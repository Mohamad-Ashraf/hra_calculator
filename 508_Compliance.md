## 508 Compliance

During the design phase of the HRA Tool project, creating a 508 compliant web application was top of mind. Every decision from the layout of page elements to the default color scheme used was centric to the goal of 508 compliance. 

While there is absolutely no substitute to manual accessibility testing, we also leveraged an online tool branded as WAVE, to ensure that each page of the application should meet the minimum compliance guidelines. Info about the WAVE tool can be found here: https://wave.webaim.org/help

It is noteworthy to mention that despite our diligence to enforce application compliance to 508 standards, it is also the responsibility of each state client to re-test compliance in their own context. Additionally, any variations to the default color scheme may cause the application to no longer conform to the WCAG 2 level AA requirements of 4:5:1 ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text, and a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user inter or normal text and 3:1 for large text. 

While due diligence has been exercised to achieve 508 compliance, there are no certifications or warranties expressed as such. It is the responsibility of each state to ensure requirements and guidelines are indeed fully met accordingly.
