The HRA Tool is an independent consumer decision support application that calculates the affordability of employer-offered Health Reimbursement Arrangements.  
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

The HRA Tool offers consumers a simple, anonymous Web interface to enter minimal information about: 1) eligible employee, and 2) HRA terms.  Based on this input, it returns a determination whether the HRA is affordable or unaffordable, and guides the consumer on next steps accordingly.  

The HRA Tool also provides a secure Administrator Portal where State-based Exchanges (SBEs) can import plan information, configure calculations according to State policies and customize the Consumer Portal to match their Exchange Web site.

This site is set up for the Community of SBEs who use the HRA Tool.  It provides instruction on how to access the software, system requirements, installing and configuring the solution.
