# useragent - high performance user agent parser for Node.js

Useragent originated as port of [browserscope.org][browserscope]'s user agent
parser project also known as ua-parser. Useragent allows you to parse user agent
string with high accuracy by using hand tuned dedicated regular expressions for
browser matching. This database is needed to ensure that every browser is
correctly parsed as every browser vendor implements it's own user agent schema.
This is why regular user agent parsers have major issues because they will
most likely parse out the wrong browser name or confuse the render engine version
with the actual version of the browser.

### High performance

The module has been developed with a benchmark driven approach. It has a
pre-compiled library that contains all the Regular Expressions and uses deferred
or on demand parsing for Operating System and device information. All this
engineering effort has been worth it as [this benchmark shows][benchmark]:

```

### Installation

Installation is done using the Node Package Manager (NPM). If you don't have
NPM installed on your system you can download it from
[npmjs.org][npm]

```
npm install useragent --save
```

The `--save` flag tells NPM to automatically add it to your `package.json` file.

### API


Include the `useragent` parser in you node.js application:

```js
var useragent = require('useragent');
```

The `useragent` library allows you do use the automatically installed RegExp
library or you can fetch it live from the remote servers. So if you are
paranoid and always want your RegExp library to be up to date to match with
agent the widest range of `useragent` strings you can do:

```js
var useragent = require('useragent');
useragent(true);
```

This will async load the database from the server and compile it to a proper
JavaScript supported format. If it fails to compile or load it from the remote
location it will just fall back silently to the shipped version. If you want to
use this feature you need to add `yamlparser` and `request` to your package.json

```
npm install yamlparser --save
npm install request --save
```

#### useragent.parse(useragent string[, js useragent]);

This is the actual user agent parser, this is where all the magic is happening.
The function accepts 2 arguments, both should be a `string`. The first argument
should the user agent string that is known on the server from the
`req.headers.useragent` header. The other argument is optional and should be
the user agent string that you see in the browser, this can be send from the
browser using a xhr request or something like this. This allows you detect if
the user is browsing the web using the `Chrome Frame` extension.

The parser returns a Agent instance, this allows you to output user agent
information in different predefined formats. See the Agent section for more
information.

```js
var agent = useragent.parse(req.headers['user-agent']);

// example for parsing both the useragent header and a optional js useragent
var agent2 = useragent.parse(req.headers['user-agent'], req.query.jsuseragent);
```

The parse method returns a `Agent` instance which contains all details about the
user agent. See the Agent section of the API documentation for the available
methods.

#### useragent.lookup(useragent string[, js useragent]);

This provides the same functionality as above, but it caches the user agent
string and it's parsed result in memory to provide faster lookups in the
future. This can be handy if you expect to parse a lot of user agent strings.

It uses the same arguments as the `useragent.parse` method and returns exactly
the same result, but it's just cached.

```js
var agent = useragent.lookup(req.headers['user-agent']);
```

And this is a serious performance improvement as shown in this benchmark:

```
Executed benchmark against method: "useragent.parse"
Count (49), Cycles (3), Elapsed (5.534), Hz (947.6844321931629)

Executed benchmark against method: "useragent.lookup"
Count (11758), Cycles (3), Elapsed (5.395), Hz (229352.03831239208)
```

#### useragent.fromJSON(obj);

Transforms the JSON representation of a `Agent` instance back in to a working
`Agent` instance

```js
var agent = useragent.parse(req.headers['user-agent'])
  , another = useragent.fromJSON(JSON.stringify(agent));

console.log(agent == another);
```

#### useragent.is(useragent string).browsername;

This api provides you with a quick and dirty browser lookup. The underlying
code is usually found on client side scripts so it's not the same quality as
our `useragent.parse` method but it might be needed for legacy reasons.

`useragent.is` returns a object with potential matched browser names

```js
useragent.is(req.headers['user-agent']).firefox // true
useragent.is(req.headers['user-agent']).safari // false
var ua = useragent.is(req.headers['user-agent'])

// the object
{
  version: '3'
  webkit: false
  opera: false
  ie: false
  chrome: false
  safari: false
  mobile_safari: false
  firefox: true
  mozilla: true
  android: false
}
```

### Agents, OperatingSystem and Device instances

Most of the methods mentioned above return a Agent instance. The Agent exposes
the parsed out information from the user agent strings. This allows us to
extend the agent with more methods that do not necessarily need to be in the
core agent instance, allowing us to expose a plugin interface for third party
developers and at the same time create a uniform interface for all versioning.

The Agent has the following property

- `family` The browser family, or browser name, it defaults to Other.
- `major` The major version number of the family, it defaults to 0.
- `minor` The minor version number of the family, it defaults to 0.
- `patch` The patch version number of the family, it defaults to 0.

In addition to the properties mentioned above, it also has 2 special properties,
which are:
