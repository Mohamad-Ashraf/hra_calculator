                <li>
                  If you are eligible for a [tax credit], using it along with your HRA will generally be your most affordable option for purchasing a plan. <strong>If you accept a [tax credit], you must reduce it by at least the amount of your HRA to help avoid having to pay back money at tax time.</strong> [You will have the chance to reduce your tax credit when you are completing the Marketplace application].
