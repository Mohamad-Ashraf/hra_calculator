## Data Center Deployment
For cloud and data center deployments, Docker Swarm will be used.  Swarm is a Docker-native clustering system.  It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual host using an API proxy system.  The instructions below describe how to provision a single node swarm.  Instructions on how to add nodes to the swarm cluster can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/get-started/part4/#set-up-your-swarm).

### Setting Up Your Swarm
In order to deploy to a Docker swarm, you have to provision one or more physical or virtual machines.  To help us do that, we are going to leverage Docker Machine.  It's a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine commands. You can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac or Windows box, on your company network, in your data center, or on cloud providers like Azure, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
